# BrainTDS

A deep learning model that detects the presence of the tumor from the MRI images. The model is trained by using the Convoluted Neural network and the MRI images, datasets available on Kaggle, are processed through OpenCV. The model has an accuracy of 96% in its prediction. The model can detect whether the MRI image is tumorous or not

### Preprocessed images containing tumour labelled as "Yes" and non tumour labelled as "No".
